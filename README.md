# LiverSegNet: Hybrid Surgical Perception System (V2.2.1-HYBRID)
[**Live Demo (Streamlit Cloud)**](https://liversegnet-nq3ncgte2bappazv7kbu7e.streamlit.app/)

LiverSegNet is a formalized hybrid perception system designed for real-time laparoscopic anatomical segmentation and kinetic safety assessment. It bridges the gap between deep learning and clinical reality by integrating multiple signal streams.

## Clinical Portfolio & Technical Advocacy
*   [**The Hybrid Imperative**](docs/hybrid_justification.md): Why we rejected "Pure AI" for surgical navigation.
*   [**Failure-Case Gallery**](docs/failure_case_gallery.md): How we handle shadows, glare, and mimicry.
*   [**Architectural Blueprint**](docs/architecture.md): Full system flow and signal definitions.

## Key Features
*   **Hybrid Perception Architecture**: Trio-signal processing (Neural, Deterministic, Heuristic).
*   **Multicolor Anatomical Recovery (MAR)**: Physically-informed BGR discovery for shadowed anatomy.
*   **Kinetic Safety Layer**: Real-time instrument tracking with velocity-adjusted risk buffers.
*   **Surgical Navigation Hub**: Streamlit dashboard with detailed hardware compute audits and temporal smoothing.
*   **Clinical Governance**: Fully kill-switchable heuristic layer and transparent signal classification.

## Quick Start
1.  **Run Dashboard**: `streamlit run ui/dashboard.py`
2.  **Execute Audit**: `python master_diag.py`

## Architecture: The Hybrid Edge
LiverSegNet V2.2.1-HYBRID utilizes a **Classified Signal Pipeline**:
1.  **NEURAL**: Primary organ/tool localization using DeepLabV3+ and UNet.
2.  **DETERMINISTIC**: Hard geometric filters, FOV masking, and anatomical shielding.
3.  **HEURISTIC**: BGR color-consistent growth (MAR) for recovering attenuated neural signals.

## Clinical Safety Gates
*   **Critical Threshold**: 20.5 px
*   **Warning Threshold**: 50.5 px
*   **Temporal Stability**: EMA-weighted instrument trajectory smoothing.

*This system is formalized and frozen under v2.2.1-hybrid governance.*
